## 0.6.1 - 2023-08-23

### Fixed

-   Fixing an issue with the data container shape when using the spatialization from gridded data.


## 0.6.0 - 2023-08-22

### Breaking changes

-   Many changes in the Forcing class:
    -   load_from_csv() was renamed to load_station_data_from_csv().
    -   define_spatialization() was renamed to spatialize_from_station_data() and is only meant for spatialization from station data.
    -   correct_station_data() was added and is to be used for applying a correction factor, for example.
    -   spatialize_from_gridded_data() was added to load data from gridded netCDF files.
    -   compute_pet() was added and uses the pyet package.
    -   The operations are not performed immediately, but only applied when apply_operations() is called, which is done automatically before the model run or before saving the forcing data to a netcdf file.
-   The Catchment class is now part of the main module.

### Added

-   Adding the spatialization from gridded data with spatialize_from_gridded_data().
-   Adding PET computation using the pyet library. New function: compute_pet().
-   The forcing data can now be loaded from the dumped netCDF file with load_from().

### Changed

-   Refactoring of the Forcing and TimeSeries classes to separate 1D and 2D data.
-   Enums are used to specify the Forcing variables.
-   The Catchment class is now part of the main module.
