## Dependencies

Get conan (requires Python 3) and setup the default profile:
```
pip install conan
conan profile new default --detect

# On Linux:
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

Add GitLab as a remote:
```
conan remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/conan
```

Get or build release libraries:
```
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
conan install .. --build=missing
```

Get or build debug libraries (the option ``-s compiler.runtime=MDd`` is for Windows only):
```
mkdir cmake-build-debug
cd cmake-build-debug
conan install .. -s build_type=Debug -s compiler.runtime=MDd --build=missing
```

Build Python wheels locally:
```
cibuildwheel --platform windows
```

Test Python wheels locally:
```
import hydrobricks as hb
help(hb.Parameter)
```
